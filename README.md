# Description:
Our site was designed as a Wordle clone, but with a twist. Wordle for coding. We used
exclusively coding terms, not all of them though. Our site allows users to log in, save
scores, and submit their own coding words. This is intended for people who want to
challenge their coding vocabulary with a fun word game. Users can also leave comments
after correctly guessing a word explaining the term and giving other helpful advice.

## User Story:
As an intelligent word and coding enthusiast, I want a site for flexing my extreme skills.
